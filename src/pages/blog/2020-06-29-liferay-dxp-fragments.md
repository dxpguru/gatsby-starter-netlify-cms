For example this content page it's just a series of fragments displayed within a single column fragments allow your marketing employees to directly edit content within the page exactly as the end user sees it without having to navigate through multiple menus or pages just by placing the cursor and selecting the text within this hero the marketer can edit directly within the content and see exactly what it will look like with the changes made in real time this is because fragments are a collection of HTML CSS and Java script that we created by a web developer with web programming knowledge.



Web developers can create and edit fragments with lifers were bused fragment creation form pictured here. 

This form allows web developers to easily see an end result of what fragments will look like to end users coming from all different devices in real time and through each channel tagging what developers can denote what areas of the fragment part editable by marketers as we saw before. 

Once the fragment as published by our web developer and web designer can then drag and drop a series of fragments onto a single page to create a page template this allows the web designer to have control over the end user experience of the page and define how content will flow from the top to the bottom. 

Then our marketer can spin up a brand new page from a web designer's page template where they can swap out all the edible text and images to mention earlier fragments our collection of HTML CSS and Java script as such they should be created and maintained by a web developer however once the fragment is created it can be reused many times by your business users for different content for now let's see how we create a fragment. 

To create a fragment you must first create a collection. A collection select the plus button at the top right of the screen give the collection a name and description then click save collections help you organize fragments in can be used to differentiate between different types of fragments or fragments used by different groups or departments. 

Next you want to create a fragment inside of the collection you just created click on the collection you created this like the plus button to create a new fragment you for fragment a name and then click submit. Now we will see the fragment creation form each painting the editor has a different function the top left pain is for entering HTML the top right pain is for interim CSS the bottom left painters for entering Java script in the bottom right pane provides a live preview as you work in the other 3 pans. 

Here we see an example of a fragment used within a product page as the web developer edits the HTML CSS or Java script we can see the preview in the bottom right paint update in real time to show what the end user will see when they view the fragment. 

From this preview pane we can also simulate what the end user will see when viewing this fragment from the desktop tablet or mobile phone. Also we can see here in the HTML pain the other one developer is able to denote what sections of the fragment or editable with the LFR editable tack this allows our web developer to define fragments that are as flexible or rigid as the desire once the marketer begin shaping the page to the messaging. 

This whole text can be used to denote editable text images or even embedded widgets next we will see how these fragments can be brought together by a web designer to create.
